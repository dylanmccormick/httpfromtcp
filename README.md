# HTTP from TCP

This is a project based on the teachings of theprimeagen on boot.dev

This is a cool project that has taught me about how TCP and HTTP works and how to parse requests in my own program. 

To run: 

You can run cmd/tcplistener/main.go and then send requests using CURL to the endpoint which is exposed. It will parse the request using HTTP 1.1

Turns out there's documentation on how HTTP works. Read it here: 
[RFC 9112](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9112.html)
